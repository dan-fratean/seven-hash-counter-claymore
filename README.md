# seven-hash-counter-claymore

*This is a POC (proof of concept)*

Just playing with pi, 7 segment display and claymore miner in order to cyclically display hash rate from several claymore miners

Download, edit the list of claymore hosts on the top of the screen and run it (tested with python 2.7)
